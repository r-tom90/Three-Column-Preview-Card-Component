### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Reminder of utilising "flex display, flex-direction: column-reverse;" CSS property to help with responsiveness to mobile sizes.

### Continued development

- Testing better methods of utilising css to get the required result. Flexbox has been my favorite method, but can not hurt to utilise grids.
